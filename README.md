Credit Card Usage Segmentation

📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on segmenting credit card users based on their spending behavior and other financial attributes.
By leveraging **unsupervised machine learning models**,
the segmentation aims to enhance **targeted marketing**
**risk assessment** 
**customer relationship management**.

 📊 Key Objectives  
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers with similar behaviors for better decision-making.  
2. **Data Insights**: Explore relationships and patterns in the dataset.  
3. **Model Comparison**: Evaluate clustering techniques to identify the best-performing model.  


🔍 Methodology  

 1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into feature distributions and relationships.  
- Missing Value Handling: Imputation for columns like `CREDIT_LIMIT` and `MINIMUM_PAYMENTS`.  
- Feature Scaling: Normalize numerical features for better model performance.  

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis): Reduce dimensionality while retaining variance.  
- **t-SNE**: Visualize high-dimensional data in a 2D space.
- 
 3. **Clustering Models**  
- **K-Means**: Identify customer segments with centroid-based clustering.  
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: Explore hierarchical clustering for grouping.  
- Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette Score, Inertia.  

4. **Visualization and Insights**  
- Visualize clusters using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  
- Interpret segmentation results for actionable insights.  

 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  


 🚀 Results  
- **Customer Segments**: Key characteristics and behaviors of each cluster.  
- **Model Performance**: Comparative analysis of clustering algorithms.  
- **Visual Insights**: Clear and interactive visualizations of clusters.
